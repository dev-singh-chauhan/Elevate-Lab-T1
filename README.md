# Elevate-Lab-T1

let's break down the steps taken in this notebook for analyzing the Titanic dataset.

1. Load and Explore the Dataset

You started by importing the pandas library for data manipulation.
Loaded the Titanic dataset using pd.read_csv().
Got an initial look at the data with df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe(). These functions provide a preview of the data, information about data types and missing values, and summary statistics for numerical columns.

2. Handling Missing Values

You identified missing values using df.isnull().sum().
Filled missing values in the 'Age' column with the median age.
Filled missing values in the 'Embarked' column with the most frequent value (mode).
Dropped the 'Cabin' column due to a large number of missing values.
Verified that missing values were handled by running df.isnull().sum() again.

3. Converting Categorical to Numerical

Used pd.get_dummies() to convert the 'Sex' and 'Embarked' columns into numerical representations. This is important for machine learning models that often work best with numerical data.
Displayed the updated dataset with df.head().

4. Normalizing Numeric Features

Imported StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
Scaled the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns using standardization. This helps ensure that these features have a similar range of values, which can improve model performance.
Displayed the normalized data with df.head().
5. Visualizing and Removing Outliers

Imported seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.
Created a box plot to visualize potential outliers in the 'Age' column, using sns.boxplot().
Calculated the interquartile range (IQR) for the 'Fare' column.
Defined upper and lower bounds to identify and remove outliers in the 'Fare' column.
In Summary

Your notebook covers essential data preprocessing steps, including loading, exploring, handling missing values, converting categorical data, normalizing numeric features, and visualizing/removing outliers. By following this data cleaning and preparation process, you create a refined dataset that's better suited for applying Machine Learning models.
